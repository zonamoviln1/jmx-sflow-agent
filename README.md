# jmx-sflow-agent
The SFlowAgent class can be attached to existing applications using the java -javaagent command line argument.
The SFlowAgent periodically exports JMX performance metrics to a central sFlow analyzer.

The java SFlowAgent is designed to work with the Host sFlow agent (which exports performance statistics from the host),
sharing configuration settings. For more information, see:
